      "[Document(page_content='M. Sc. Data Science and Analytics\\nObjectives of the Program :\\nIn the emerging data driven world, Data Science and Data Analytics are receiving much acceptance in the national and international levels for making wise decisions. Data analytics is  an essential field that brings together Data, technology, information, statistical analysis all in one platform. Every organization in private/ public sector creates a large volume of data from almost every area of daily activity. Analyzing such data has huge potential to predict the future of the organization. A good amount of knowledge is very necessary in the field of data management, machine learning, natural language processing as they are the key factors in Data Science. The decision to establish a School of Data Analytics along with the School of Mathematics & Statistics in the Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam during 2020-21 is a most appropriate decision and will help the research and career opportunities for prospective students.\\n\\nIn the proposed curriculum for M.Sc. Data Science and Analytics, apart from teaching core subjects, the students are also offered training in programming languages and open softwares such as R, Python, etc to handle real life problems through the practical classes. As part of the program the students are also given training in computing softwares like SPSS, SAS etc. The program is so designed that on successful completion, the students would be able to pursue research or higher studies in the areas of Data Science, Data Analytics, Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Economics, Management and allied fields. Moreover, emerging areas like Bayesian Inference and Computing, Stochastic Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, Internet of Things and Fraud Analytics are included in the curriculum. There will be an open course during third semester to encourage interdisciplinary studies and research. This can be selected from among courses offered by any other school/department/centre in the university. The following are some of the emerging areas of applications in this respect.\\n\\nInternet of Things (IoT): Analytics tools and techniques for dealing with the massive amounts of structured and unstructured data generated by IoT will continue to gain importance.\\nFinance and Banking: Creating newer business models or frameworks that leverages the available data to facilitate financial institutions to monetize data to deliver superior customer values.\\nData Security: Fraud Security Analytics are already transforming intrusion detection, differential privacy, digital watermarking and malware countermeasures.\\nHealth Care: Health Care Analytics and Predictive Analytics enable the examination of patterns in various healthcare data in order to determine how clinical care can be improved while limiting excessive spending.\\nThere has been much interest in Bayesian Inference in Data Analytics in recent years. It is a way to get sharper predictions from the data, particularly when there is not much data available and when one want to juice every last bit of information from it. During the last three decades, Actuarial Science has gone through revolutionary changes due to the implementation of high speed computers and modern theory. It applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in insurance, finance and other industries. Official Statistics make information on economic and social development accessible to the public, allowing the impact of government polices to be assessed and thus improving accountability.\\nWith the emergence of new diseases like AIDS, SARS, COVID 19 etc. more interest has come to analyze such epidemic data to study the dynamics of its spread. In the modern data driven world Data Science and Data Analytics are the principal tools for making wise decisions and drawing valid conclusions. We expect students to select the elective courses to ensure employment and research opportunities in emerging areas. The main thrust of the program will be to enable students to understand basic concepts and applications through real data sets using computer programs like R and Python in the data analytics lab rather than just imparting theory. Industry interaction, case studies and projects will be main components of all courses.\\n\\nEligibility for admissions:\\nB.Sc. Degree in Mathematics or Statistics or Computer Science main / B.Sc.

Data Science and Analytics\\nObjectives of the Program :\\nIn the emerging data driven world, Data Science and Data Analytics are receiving much acceptance in the national and international levels for making wise decisions. Data analytics is  an essential field that brings together Data, technology, information, statistical analysis all in one platform. Every organization in private/ public sector creates a large volume of data from almost every area of daily activity. Analyzing such data has huge potential to predict the future of the organization. A good amount of knowledge is very necessary in the field of data management, machine learning, natural language processing as they are the key factors in Data Science. The decision to establish a School of Data Analytics along with the School of Mathematics & Statistics in the Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam during 2020-21 is a most appropriate decision and will help the research and career opportunities for prospective students.' metadata={'source': 'MG University.txt'}\n",
